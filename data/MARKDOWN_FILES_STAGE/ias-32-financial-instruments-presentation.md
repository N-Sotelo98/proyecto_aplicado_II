International Accounting Standard 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation (IAS 32) is set
out in paragraphs 2-100 and the Appendix. All the paragraphs have equal authority
but retain the IASC format of the Standard when it was adopted by the IASB. IAS 32
should be read in the context of its objective and the Basis for Conclusions, the Preface
to IFRS Standards and the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting. IAS 8 Accounting
Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors provides a basis for selecting and
applying accounting policies in the absence of explicit guidance.

IAS 32

**International Accounting Standard 32**
**Financial Instruments: Presentation**

**Objective**

1 [Deleted]
2 The objective of this Standard is to establish principles for presenting financial instruments as liabilities or equity and for offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities. It applies to the classification of financial instruments, from the perspective of the issuer, into financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments; the classification of related interest, dividends, losses and gains; and the circumstances in which financial assets and financial liabilities should be offset.
3 The principles in this Standard complement the principles for recognising and measuring financial assets and financial liabilities in IFRS 9 *Financial Instruments*, and for disclosing information about them in IFRS 7 *Financial Instruments: Disclosures*.

**Scope**

4 This Standard shall be applied by all entities to all types of financial instruments except:
(a) those interests in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures that are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 10 *Consolidated Financial Statements*, IAS 27 *Separate Financial Statements* or IAS 28 *Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures*. However, in some cases, IFRS 10, IAS 27 or IAS 28 require or permit an entity to account for an interest in a subsidiary, associate or joint venture using IFRS 9; in those cases, entities shall apply the requirements of this Standard. Entities shall also apply this Standard to all derivatives linked to interests in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures.
(b) employers' rights and obligations under employee benefit plans, to which IAS 19 *Employee Benefits* applies.
(c) [deleted]
(d) insurance contracts as defined in IFRS 17 *Insurance Contracts* or investment contracts with discretionary participation features within the scope of IFRS 17. However, this Standard applies to:
    (i) derivatives that are embedded in contracts within the scope of IFRS 17, if IFRS 9 requires the entity to account for them separately.

IAS 32

(ii) investment components that are separated from contracts
within the scope of IFRS 17, if IFRS 17 requires such
separation, unless the separated investment component is an
investment contract with discretionary participation
features within the scope of IFRS 17.

(iii) an issuer's rights and obligations arising under insurance
contracts that meet the definition of financial guarantee
contracts, if the issuer applies IFRS 9 in recognising and
measuring the contracts. However, the issuer shall apply
IFRS 17 if the issuer elects, in accordance with paragraph 7(e)
of IFRS 17, to apply IFRS 17 in recognising and measuring the
contracts.

(iv) an entity's rights and obligations that are financial
instruments arising under credit card contracts, or similar
contracts that provide credit or payment arrangements, that
an entity issues that meet the definition of an insurance
contract if the entity applies IFRS 9 to those rights and
obligations in accordance with paragraph 7(h) of IFRS 17 and
paragraph 2.1(e) (iv) of IFRS 9.

(v) an entity's rights and obligations that are financial
instruments arising under insurance contracts that an entity
issues that limit the compensation for insured events to the
amount otherwise required to settle the policyholder's
obligation created by the contract if the entity elects, in
accordance with paragraph 8A of IFRS 17, to apply IFRS 9
instead of IFRS 17 to such contracts.

(e) [deleted]

(f) financial instruments, contracts and obligations under share-based
payment transactions to which IFRS 2 Share-based Payment applies,
except for

(i) contracts within the scope of paragraphs 8-10 of this
Standard, to which this Standard applies,

(ii) paragraphs 33 and 34 of this Standard, which shall be
applied to treasury shares purchased, sold, issued or
cancelled in connection with employee share option plans,
employee share purchase plans, and all other share-based
payment arrangements.

5-7 [Deleted]

8 This Standard shall be applied to those contracts to buy or sell a non-
financial item that can be settled net in cash or another financial
instrument, or by exchanging financial instruments, as if the contracts
were financial instruments, with the exception of contracts that were
entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or
delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with the entity's expected

IAS 32

purchase, sale or usage requirements. However, this Standard shall be applied to those contracts that an entity designates as measured at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with paragraph 2.5 of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments.

9 There are various ways in which a contract to buy or sell a non-financial item can be settled net in cash or another financial instrument or by exchanging financial instruments. These include:

(a) when the terms of the contract permit either party to settle it net in cash or another financial instrument or by exchanging financial instruments;

(b) when the ability to settle net in cash or another financial instrument, or by exchanging financial instruments, is not explicit in the terms of the contract, but the entity has a practice of settling similar contracts net in cash or another financial instrument, or by exchanging financial instruments (whether with the counterparty, by entering into offsetting contracts or by selling the contract before its exercise or lapse);

(c) when, for similar contracts, the entity has a practice of taking delivery of the underlying and selling it within a short period after delivery for the purpose of generating a profit from short-term fluctuations in price or dealer's margin; and

(d) when the non-financial item that is the subject of the contract is readily convertible to cash.

A contract to which (b) or (c) applies is not entered into for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of the non-financial item in accordance with the entity's expected purchase, sale or usage requirements, and, accordingly, is within the scope of this Standard. Other contracts to which paragraph 8 applies are evaluated to determine whether they were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of the non-financial item in accordance with the entity's expected purchase, sale or usage requirement, and accordingly, whether they are within the scope of this Standard.

10 A written option to buy or sell a non-financial item that can be settled net in cash or another financial instrument, or by exchanging financial instruments, in accordance with paragraph 9(a) or (d) is within the scope of this Standard. Such a contract cannot be entered into for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of the non-financial item in accordance with the entity's expected purchase, sale or usage requirements.

**Definitions (see also paragraphs AG3-AG23)**

11 The following terms are used in this Standard with the meanings specified:

*A financial instrument* is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

A1330 © IFRS Foundation
```####End####```markdown
IAS 32

A financial asset is any asset that is:

(a) cash;

(b) an equity instrument of another entity;

(c) a contractual right:
  (i) to receive cash or another financial asset from another entity; or
  (ii) to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially favourable to the entity; or

(d) a contract that will or may be settled in the entity's own equity instruments and is:
  (i) a non-derivative for which the entity is or may be obliged to receive a variable number of the entity's own equity instruments; or
  (ii) a derivative that will or may be settled other than by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of the entity's own equity instruments.
  For this purpose the entity's own equity instruments do not include puttable financial instruments classified as equity instruments in accordance with paragraphs 16A and 16B, instruments that impose on the entity an obligation to deliver to another party a pro rata share of the net assets of the entity only on liquidation and are classified as equity instruments in accordance with paragraphs 16C and 16D, or instruments that are contracts for the future receipt or delivery of the entity's own equity instruments.

A financial liability is any liability that is:

(a) a contractual obligation:
  (i) to deliver cash or another financial asset to another entity; or
  (ii) to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the entity; or

(b) a contract that will or may be settled in the entity's own equity instruments and is:
  (i) a non-derivative for which the entity is or may be obliged to deliver a variable number of the entity's own equity instruments; or

13 In this Standard, 'contract' and 'contractual' refer to an agreement between two or more parties that has clear economic consequences that the parties have little, if any, discretion to avoid, usually because the agreement is enforceable by law. Contracts, and thus financial instruments, may take a variety of forms and need not be in writing.

14 In this Standard, 'entity' includes individuals, partnerships, incorporated bodies, trusts and government agencies.

### Presentation

#### Liabilities and equity (see also paragraphs AG13-AG14J and AG25-AG29A)

15 The issuer of a financial instrument shall classify the instrument, or its component parts, on initial recognition as a financial liability, a financial asset or an equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement and the definitions of a financial liability, a financial asset and an equity instrument.

16 When an issuer applies the definitions in paragraph 11 to determine whether a financial instrument is an equity instrument rather than a financial liability, the instrument is an equity instrument if, and only if, both conditions (a) and (b) below are met.

(a) The instrument includes no contractual obligation:

(i) to deliver cash or another financial asset to another entity; or

(ii) to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the issuer.

(b) If the instrument will or may be settled in the issuer's own equity instruments, it is:

(i) a non-derivative that includes no contractual obligation for the issuer to deliver a variable number of its own equity instruments; or
```####End####page_1'-not-possible####End####page_1-Not-possible####End####page_1'-not-possible####End####page_1'-not-possible####End####```markdown
IAS 32

(b) a financial instrument that gives the holder the right to put it back to
the issuer for cash or another financial asset (a 'puttable instrument')
is a financial liability, except for those instruments classified as equity
instruments in accordance with paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs
16C and 16D. The financial instrument is a financial liability even
when the amount of cash or other financial assets is determined on the
basis of an index or other item that has the potential to increase or
decrease. The existence of an option for the holder to put the
instrument back to the issuer for cash or another financial asset means
that the puttable instrument meets the definition of a financial
liability, except for those instruments classified as equity instruments
in accordance with paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and
16D. For example, open-ended mutual funds, unit trusts, partnerships
and some co-operative entities may provide their unitholders or
members with a right to redeem their interests in the issuer at any
time for cash, which results in the unitholders' or members' interests
being classified as financial liabilities, except for those instruments
classified as equity instruments in accordance with paragraphs 16A
and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D. However, classification as a
financial liability does not preclude the use of descriptors such as 'net
asset value attributable to unitholders' and 'change in net asset value
attributable to unitholders' in the financial statements of an entity
that has no contributed equity (such as some mutual funds and unit
trusts, see Illustrative Example 7) or the use of additional disclosure to
show that total members' interests comprise items such as reserves
that meet the definition of equity and puttable instruments that do
not (see Illustrative Example 8).

19 If an entity does not have an unconditional right to avoid delivering cash or
another financial asset to settle a contractual obligation, the obligation meets
the definition of a financial liability, except for those instruments classified as
equity instruments in accordance with paragraphs 16A and 16B or
paragraphs 16C and 16D. For example:

(a) a restriction on the ability of an entity to satisfy a contractual
obligation, such as lack of access to foreign currency or the need to
obtain approval for payment from a regulatory authority, does not
negate the entity's contractual obligation or the holder's contractual
right under the instrument.

(b) a contractual obligation that is conditional on a counterparty
exercising its right to redeem is a financial liability because the entity
does not have the unconditional right to avoid delivering cash or
another financial asset.

20 A financial instrument that does not explicitly establish a contractual
obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset may establish an
obligation indirectly through its terms and conditions. For example:

# IAS 32

received, or the number of equity instruments to be received or delivered, on settlement of the contract do not preclude the contract from being an equity instrument. Any consideration received (such as the premium received for a written option or warrant on the entity's own shares) is added directly to equity. Any consideration paid (such as the premium paid for a purchased option) is deducted directly from equity. Changes in the fair value of an equity instrument are not recognised in the financial statements.

22A If the entity's own equity instruments to be received, or delivered, by the entity upon settlement of a contract are puttable financial instruments with all the features and meeting the conditions described in paragraphs 16A and 16B, or instruments that impose on the entity an obligation to deliver to another party a pro rata share of the net assets of the entity only on liquidation with all the features and meeting the conditions described in paragraphs 16C and 16D, the contract is a financial asset or a financial liability. This includes a contract that will be settled by the entity receiving or delivering a fixed number of such instruments in exchange for a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset.

23 With the exception of the circumstances described in paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D, a contract that contains an obligation for an entity to purchase its own equity instruments for cash or another financial asset gives rise to a financial liability for the present value of the redemption amount (for example, for the present value of the forward repurchase price, option exercise price or other redemption amount). This is the case even if the contract itself is an equity instrument. One example is an entity's obligation under a forward contract to purchase its own equity instruments for cash. The financial liability is recognised initially at the present value of the redemption amount, and is reclassified from equity. Subsequently, the financial liability is measured in accordance with IFRS 9. If the contract expires without delivery, the carrying amount of the financial liability is reclassified to equity. An entity's contractual obligation to purchase its own equity instruments gives rise to a financial liability for the present value of the redemption amount even if the obligation to purchase is conditional on the counterparty exercising a right to redeem (eg a written put option that gives the counterparty the right to sell an entity's own equity instruments to the entity for a fixed price).

24 A contract that will be settled by the entity delivering or receiving a fixed number of its own equity instruments in exchange for a variable amount of cash or another financial asset is a financial asset or financial liability. An example is a contract for the entity to deliver 100 of its own equity instruments in return for an amount of cash calculated to equal the value of 100 ounces of gold.

25 **Contingent settlement provisions**
A financial instrument may require the entity to deliver cash or another financial asset, or otherwise to settle it in such a way that it would be a financial liability, in the event of the occurrence or non-occurrence of uncertain future events (or on the outcome of uncertain circumstances) that

IAS 32

43 In accounting for a transfer of a financial asset that does not qualify for derecognition, the entity shall not offset the transferred asset and the associated liability (see IFRS 9, paragraph 3.2.22).

This Standard requires the presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities on a net basis when doing so reflects an entity's expected future cash flows from settling two or more separate financial instruments. When an entity has the right to receive or pay a single net amount and intends to do so, it has, in effect, only a single financial asset or financial liability. In other circumstances, financial assets and financial liabilities are presented separately from each other consistently with their characteristics as resources or obligations of the entity. An entity shall disclose the information required in paragraphs 13B-13E of IFRS 7 for recognised financial instruments that are within the scope of paragraph 13A of IFRS 7.

44 Offsetting a recognised financial asset and a recognised financial liability and presenting the net amount differs from the derecognition of a financial asset or a financial liability. Although offsetting does not give rise to recognition of a gain or loss, the derecognition of a financial instrument not only results in the removal of the previously recognised item from the statement of financial position but also may result in recognition of a gain or loss.

45 A right of set-off is a debtor's legal right, by contract or otherwise, to settle or otherwise eliminate all or a portion of an amount due to a creditor by applying against that amount an amount due from the creditor. In unusual circumstances, a debtor may have a legal right to apply an amount due from a third party against the amount due to a creditor provided that there is an agreement between the three parties that clearly establishes the debtor's right of set-off. Because the right of set-off is a legal right, the conditions supporting the right may vary from one legal jurisdiction to another and the laws applicable to the relationships between the parties need to be considered.

46 The existence of an enforceable right to set off a financial asset and a financial liability affects the rights and obligations associated with a financial asset and a financial liability and may affect an entity's exposure to credit and liquidity risk. However, the existence of the right, by itself, is not a sufficient basis for offsetting. In the absence of an intention to exercise the right or to settle simultaneously, the amount and timing of an entity's future cash flows are not affected. When an entity intends to exercise the right or to settle simultaneously, presentation of the asset and liability on a net basis reflects more appropriately the amounts and timing of the expected future cash flows, as well as the risks to which those cash flows are exposed. An intention by one or both parties to settle on a net basis without the legal right to do so is not sufficient to justify offsetting because the rights and obligations associated with the individual financial asset and financial liability remain unaltered.

47 An entity's intentions with respect to settlement of particular assets and liabilities may be influenced by its normal business practices, the requirements of the financial markets and other circumstances that may limit the ability to settle net or to settle simultaneously. When an entity has a right of set-off, but does not intend to settle net or to realise the asset and settle the

arrangement are not offset, the effect of the arrangement on an entity's
exposure to credit risk is disclosed in accordance with paragraph 36 of IFRS 7.

## Effective date and transition

96 An entity shall apply this Standard for annual periods beginning on or after
1 January 2005. Earlier application is permitted. An entity shall not apply this
Standard for annual periods beginning before 1 January 2005 unless it also
applies IAS 39 (issued December 2003), including the amendments issued in
March 2004. If an entity applies this Standard for a period beginning before
1 January 2005, it shall disclose that fact.

96A *Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation (Amendments
to IAS 32 and IAS 1)*, issued in February 2008, required financial instruments
that contain all the features and meet the conditions in paragraphs 16A and
16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D to be classified as an equity instrument,
amended paragraphs 11, 16, 17-19, 22, 23, 25, AG13, AG14 and AG27, and
inserted paragraphs 16A-16F, 22A, 96B, 96C, 97C, AG14A-AG14J and AG29A.
An entity shall apply those amendments for annual periods beginning on or
after 1 January 2009. Earlier application is permitted. If an entity applies the
changes for an earlier period, it shall disclose that fact and apply the related
amendments to IAS 1, IAS 39, IFRS 7 and IFRIC 2 at the same time.

96B *Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation* introduced a
limited scope exception; therefore, an entity shall not apply the exception by
analogy.

96C The classification of instruments under this exception shall be restricted to
the accounting for such an instrument under IAS 1, IAS 32, IAS 39, IFRS 7 and
IFRS 9. The instrument shall not be considered an equity instrument under
other guidance, for example IFRS 2.

97 This Standard shall be applied retrospectively.

97A IAS 1 (as revised in 2007) amended the terminology used throughout IFRSs. In
addition it amended paragraph 40. An entity shall apply those amendments
for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. If an entity applies
IAS 1 (revised 2007) for an earlier period, the amendments shall be applied for
that earlier period.

97B IFRS 3 *Business Combinations* (as revised in 2008) deleted paragraph 4(c). An
entity shall apply that amendment for annual periods beginning on or after
1 July 2009. If an entity applies IFRS 3 (revised 2008) for an earlier period, the
amendment shall also be applied for that earlier period. However, the
amendment does not apply to contingent consideration that arose from a
business combination for which the acquisition date preceded the application
of IFRS 3 (revised 2008). Instead, an entity shall account for such consideration
in accordance with paragraphs 65A-65E of IFRS 3 (as amended in 2010).

IAS 32

97C When applying the amendments described in paragraph 96A, an entity is required to split a compound financial instrument with an obligation to deliver to another party a pro rata share of the net assets of the entity only on liquidation into separate liability and equity components. If the liability component is no longer outstanding, a retrospective application of those amendments to IAS 32 would involve separating two components of equity. The first component would be in retained earnings and represent the cumulative interest accreted on the liability component. The other component would represent the original equity component. Therefore, an entity need not separate these two components if the liability component is no longer outstanding at the date of application of the amendments.

97D Paragraph 4 was amended by Improvements to IFRSs issued in May 2008. An entity shall apply that amendment for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. Earlier application is permitted. If an entity applies the amendment for an earlier period it shall disclose that fact and apply for that earlier period the amendments to paragraph 3 of IFRS 7, paragraph 1 of IAS 28 and paragraph 1 of IAS 31 issued in May 2008. An entity is permitted to apply the amendment prospectively.

97E Paragraphs 11 and 16 were amended by *Classification of Rights Issues* issued in October 2009. An entity shall apply that amendment for annual periods beginning on or after 1 February 2010. Earlier application is permitted. If an entity applies the amendment for an earlier period, it shall disclose that fact.

97F [Deleted]

97G Paragraph 97B was amended by *Improvements to IFRSs* issued in May 2010. An entity shall apply that amendment for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2010. Earlier application is permitted.

97H [Deleted]

97I IFRS 10 and IFRS 11 *Joint Arrangements*, issued in May 2011, amended paragraphs 4(a) and AG29. An entity shall apply those amendments when it applies IFRS 10 and IFRS 11.

97J IFRS 13, issued in May 2011, amended the definition of fair value in paragraph 11 and amended paragraphs 23 and AG31. An entity shall apply those amendments when it applies IFRS 13.

97K *Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income* (Amendments to IAS 1), issued in June 2011, amended paragraph 40. An entity shall apply that amendment when it applies IAS 1 as amended in June 2011.

97L *Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities* (Amendments to IAS 32), issued in December 2011, deleted paragraph AG38 and added paragraphs AG38A–AG38F. An entity shall apply those amendments for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. An entity shall apply those amendments retrospectively. Earlier application is permitted. If an entity applies those amendments from an earlier date, it shall disclose that fact and shall also make the disclosures required by *Disclosures—Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities* (Amendments to IFRS 7) issued in December 2011.

An entity shall apply that amendment for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 and interim periods within those annual periods. An entity shall provide the disclosures required by this amendment retrospectively.

97N  Annual Improvements 2009–2011 Cycle, issued in May 2012, amended paragraphs 35, 37 and 39 and added paragraph 35A. An entity shall apply that amendment retrospectively in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. Earlier application is permitted. If an entity applies that amendment for an earlier period it shall disclose that fact.

97O  Investment Entities (Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27), issued in October 2012, amended paragraph 4. An entity shall apply that amendment for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. Earlier application of Investment Entities is permitted. If an entity applies that amendment earlier it shall also apply all amendments included in Investment Entities at the same time.

## IAS 32

(b) An entity's obligation to purchase its own shares for cash gives rise to a financial liability for the present value of the redemption amount even if the number of shares that the entity is obliged to repurchase is not fixed or if the obligation is conditional on the counterparty exercising a right to redeem (except as stated in paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D). One example of a conditional obligation is an issued option that requires the entity to repurchase its own shares for cash if the counterparty exercises the option.

(c) A contract that will be settled in cash or another financial asset is a financial asset or financial liability even if the amount of cash or another financial asset that will be received or delivered is based on changes in the market price of the entity's own equity (except as stated in paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D). One example is a net cash-settled share option.

(d) A contract that will be settled in a variable number of the entity's own shares whose value equals a fixed amount or an amount based on changes in an underlying variable (eg a commodity price) is a financial asset or a financial liability. An example is a written option to buy gold that, if exercised, is settled net in the entity's own instruments by the entity delivering as many of those instruments as are equal to the value of the option contract. Such a contract is a financial asset or financial liability even if the underlying variable is the entity's own share price rather than gold. Similarly, a contract that will be settled in a fixed number of the entity's own shares, but the rights attaching to those shares will be varied so that the settlement value equals a fixed amount or an amount based on changes in an underlying variable, is a financial asset or a financial liability.

**AG28 Contingent settlement provisions (paragraph 25)**

Paragraph 25 requires that if a part of a contingent settlement provision that could require settlement in cash or another financial asset (or in another way that would result in the instrument being a financial liability) is not genuine, the settlement provision does not affect the classification of a financial instrument. Thus, a contract that requires settlement in cash or a variable number of the entity's own shares only on the occurrence of an event that is extremely rare, highly abnormal and very unlikely to occur is an equity instrument. Similarly, settlement in a fixed number of an entity's own shares may be contractually precluded in circumstances that are outside the control of the entity, but if these circumstances have no genuine possibility of occurring, classification as an equity instrument is appropriate.

**AG29 Treatment in consolidated financial statements**

In consolidated financial statements, an entity presents non-controlling interests ie the interests of other parties in the equity and income of its subsidiaries - in accordance with IAS 1 and IFRS 10. When classifying a financial instrument (or a component of it) in consolidated financial statements, an entity considers all terms and conditions agreed between.
