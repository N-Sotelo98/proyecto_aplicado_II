IAS 36

**International Accounting Standard 36
Impairment of Assets**

**Objective**

1 The objective of this Standard is to prescribe the procedures that an entity
applies to ensure that its assets are carried at no more than their recoverable
amount. An asset is carried at more than its recoverable amount if its carrying
amount exceeds the amount to be recovered through use or sale of the asset.
If this is the case, the asset is described as impaired and the Standard requires
the entity to recognise an impairment loss. The Standard also specifies when
an entity should reverse an impairment loss and prescribes disclosures.

**Scope**

2 This Standard shall be applied in accounting for the impairment of all
assets, other than:

(a) inventories (see IAS 2 *Inventories*);

(b) contract assets and assets arising from costs to obtain or fulfil a
contract that are recognised in accordance with IFRS 15 *Revenue
from Contracts with Customers*;

(c) deferred tax assets (see IAS 12 *Income Taxes*);

(d) assets arising from employee benefits (see IAS 19 *Employee Benefits*);

(e) financial assets that are within the scope of IFRS 9 *Financial
Instruments*;

(f) investment property that is measured at fair value (see IAS 40
*Investment Property*);

(g) biological assets related to agricultural activity within the scope of
IAS 41 *Agriculture* that are measured at fair value less costs to sell;

(h) contracts within the scope of IFRS 17 *Insurance Contracts* that are
assets and any assets for insurance acquisition cash flows as defined
in IFRS 17; and

(i) non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale in
accordance with IFRS 5 *Non-current Assets Held for Sale and
Discontinued Operations*.

3 This Standard does not apply to inventories, assets arising from construction
contracts, deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits, or assets
classified as held for sale (or included in a disposal group that is classified as
held for sale) because existing IFRSs applicable to these assets contain
requirements for recognising and measuring these assets.

4 This Standard applies to financial assets classified as:

(a) subsidiaries, as defined in IFRS 10 *Consolidated Financial Statements*;

```####End####```markdown
IAS 36

(b) associates, as defined in IAS 28 *Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures*; and
(c) joint ventures, as defined in IFRS 11 *Joint Arrangements*.

For impairment of other financial assets, refer to IFRS 9.

5 This Standard does not apply to financial assets within the scope of IFRS 9, investment property measured at fair value within the scope of IAS 40, or biological assets related to agricultural activity measured at fair value less costs to sell within the scope of IAS 41. However, this Standard applies to assets that are carried at revalued amount (ie fair value at the date of the revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses) in accordance with other IFRSs, such as the revaluation model in IAS 16 *Property, Plant and Equipment* and IAS 38 *Intangible Assets*. The only difference between an asset's fair value and its fair value less costs of disposal is the direct incremental costs attributable to the disposal of the asset.

(a) If the disposal costs are negligible, the recoverable amount of the revalued asset is necessarily close to, or greater than, its revalued amount. In this case, after the revaluation requirements have been applied, it is unlikely that the revalued asset is impaired and recoverable amount need not be estimated.
(b) [deleted]
(c) If the disposal costs are not negligible, the fair value less costs of disposal of the revalued asset is necessarily less than its fair value. Therefore, the revalued asset will be impaired if its value in use is less than its revalued amount. In this case, after the revaluation requirements have been applied, an entity applies this Standard to determine whether the asset may be impaired.

## Definitions

6 The following terms are used in this Standard with the meanings specified:

*Carrying amount* is the amount at which an asset is recognised after deducting any accumulated depreciation (amortisation) and accumulated impairment losses thereon.

*A cash-generating unit* is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.

*Corporate assets* are assets other than goodwill that contribute to the future cash flows of both the cash-generating unit under review and other cash-generating units.

*Costs of disposal* are incremental costs directly attributable to the disposal of an asset or cash-generating unit, excluding finance costs and income tax expense.

IAS 36

Depreciable amount is the cost of an asset, or other amount substituted for cost in the financial statements, less its residual value.

*Depreciation (Amortisation)* is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life.¹

*Fair value* is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. (See IFRS 13 *Fair Value Measurement*.)

*An impairment loss* is the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.

The *recoverable amount* of an asset or a cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.

Useful life is either:

(a) the period of time over which an asset is expected to be used by the entity; or

(b) the number of production or similar units expected to be obtained from the asset by the entity.

*Value in use* is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit.

### Identifying an asset that may be impaired

7 Paragraphs 8–17 specify when recoverable amount shall be determined. These requirements use the term ‘an asset’ but apply equally to an individual asset or a cash-generating unit. The remainder of this Standard is structured as follows:

(a) paragraphs 18–57 set out the requirements for measuring recoverable amount. These requirements also use the term ‘an asset’ but apply equally to an individual asset and a cash-generating unit.

(b) paragraphs 58–108 set out the requirements for recognising and measuring impairment losses. Recognition and measurement of impairment losses for individual assets other than goodwill are dealt with in paragraphs 58–64. Paragraphs 65–108 deal with the recognition and measurement of impairment losses for cash-generating units and goodwill.

(c) paragraphs 109–116 set out the requirements for reversing an impairment loss recognised in prior periods for an asset or a cash-generating unit. Again, these requirements use the term ‘an asset’ but apply equally to an individual asset or a cash-generating unit. Additional requirements for an individual asset are set out in paragraphs 117–121, for a cash-generating unit in paragraphs 122 and 123, and for goodwill in paragraphs 124 and 125.

¹ In the case of an intangible asset, the term ‘amortisation’ is generally used instead of ‘depreciation’. The two terms have the same meaning.

IAS 36

(b) significant changes with an adverse effect on the entity have taken place during the period, or will take place in the near future, in the technological, market, economic or legal environment in which the entity operates or in the market to which an asset is dedicated.

(c) market interest rates or other market rates of return on investments have increased during the period, and those increases are likely to affect the discount rate used in calculating an asset's value in use and decrease the asset's recoverable amount materially.

(d) the carrying amount of the net assets of the entity is more than its market capitalisation.

**Internal sources of information**

(e) evidence is available of obsolescence or physical damage of an asset.

(f) significant changes with an adverse effect on the entity have taken place during the period, or are expected to take place in the near future, in the extent to which, or manner in which, an asset is used or is expected to be used. These changes include the asset becoming idle, plans to discontinue or restructure the operation to which an asset belongs, plans to dispose of an asset before the previously expected date, and reassessing the useful life of an asset as finite rather than indefinite.

(g) evidence is available from internal reporting that indicates that the economic performance of an asset is, or will be, worse than expected.

**Dividend from a subsidiary, joint venture or associate**

(h) for an investment in a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the investor recognises a dividend from the investment and evidence is available that:

(i) the carrying amount of the investment in the separate financial statements exceeds the carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements of the investee's net assets, including associated goodwill; or

(ii) the dividend exceeds the total comprehensive income of the subsidiary, joint venture or associate in the period the dividend is declared.

13 The list in paragraph 12 is not exhaustive. An entity may identify other indications that an asset may be impaired and these would also require the entity to determine the asset's recoverable amount or, in the case of goodwill, perform an impairment test in accordance with paragraphs 80-99.

2 Once an asset meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale (or is included in a disposal group that is classified as held for sale), it is excluded from the scope of this Standard and is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.

IAS 36

14 Evidence from internal reporting that indicates that an asset may be impaired includes the existence of:

(a) cash flows for acquiring the asset, or subsequent cash needs for operating or maintaining it, that are significantly higher than those originally budgeted;

(b) actual net cash flows or operating profit or loss flowing from the asset that are significantly worse than those budgeted;

(c) a significant decline in budgeted net cash flows or operating profit, or a significant increase in budgeted loss, flowing from the asset; or

(d) operating losses or net cash outflows for the asset, when current period amounts are aggregated with budgeted amounts for the future.

15 As indicated in paragraph 10, this Standard requires an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life or not yet available for use and goodwill to be tested for impairment, at least annually. Apart from when the requirements in paragraph 10 apply, the concept of materiality applies in identifying whether the recoverable amount of an asset needs to be estimated. For example, if previous calculations show that an asset's recoverable amount is significantly greater than its carrying amount, the entity need not re-estimate the asset's recoverable amount if no events have occurred that would eliminate that difference. Similarly, previous analysis may show that an asset's recoverable amount is not sensitive to one (or more) of the indications listed in paragraph 12.

16 As an illustration of paragraph 15, if market interest rates or other market rates of return on investments have increased during the period, an entity is not required to make a formal estimate of an asset's recoverable amount in the following cases:

(a) if the discount rate used in calculating the asset's value in use is unlikely to be affected by the increase in these market rates. For example, increases in short-term interest rates may not have a material effect on the discount rate used for an asset that has a long remaining useful life.

(b) if the discount rate used in calculating the asset's value in use is likely to be affected by the increase in these market rates but previous sensitivity analysis of recoverable amount shows that:
  (i) it is unlikely that there will be a material decrease in recoverable amount because future cash flows are also likely to increase (eg in some cases, an entity may be able to demonstrate that it adjusts its revenues to compensate for any increase in market rates); or
  (ii) the decrease in recoverable amount is unlikely to result in a material impairment loss.

(c) the basis on which the unit's (group of units') recoverable amount has been determined (ie value in use or fair value less costs of disposal).

(d) if the unit's (group of units') recoverable amount is based on value in use:

  (i) each key assumption on which management has based its cash flow projections for the period covered by the most recent budgets/forecasts. Key assumptions are those to which the unit's (group of units') recoverable amount is most sensitive.

  (ii) a description of management's approach to determining the value(s) assigned to each key assumption, whether those value(s) reflect past experience or, if appropriate, are consistent with external sources of information, and, if not, how and why they differ from past experience or external sources of information.

  (iii) the period over which management has projected cash flows based on financial budgets/forecasts approved by management and, when a period greater than five years is used for a cash-generating unit (group of units), an explanation of why that longer period is justified.

  (iv) the growth rate used to extrapolate cash flow projections beyond the period covered by the most recent budgets/ forecasts, and the justification for using any growth rate that exceeds the long-term average growth rate for the products, industries, or country or countries in which the entity operates, or for the market to which the unit (group of units) is dedicated.

  (v) the discount rate(s) applied to the cash flow projections.

(e) if the unit's (group of units') recoverable amount is based on fair value less costs of disposal, the valuation technique(s) used to measure fair value less costs of disposal. An entity is not required to provide the disclosures required by IFRS 13. If fair value less costs of disposal is not measured using a quoted price for an identical unit (group of units), an entity shall disclose the following information:

  (i) each key assumption on which management has based its determination of fair value less costs of disposal. Key assumptions are those to which the unit's (group of units') recoverable amount is most sensitive.

  (ii) a description of management's approach to determining the value (or values) assigned to each key assumption, whether those values reflect past experience or, if appropriate, are consistent with external sources of information, and, if not,

Appendix A
Using present value techniques to measure value in use

This appendix is an integral part of the Standard. It provides guidance on the use of present value techniques in measuring value in use. Although the guidance uses the term 'asset', it equally applies to a group of assets forming a cash-generating unit.

**The components of a present value measurement**

A1 The following elements together capture the economic differences between assets:

(a) an estimate of the future cash flow, or in more complex cases, series of future cash flows the entity expects to derive from the asset;

(b) expectations about possible variations in the amount or timing of those cash flows;

(c) the time value of money, represented by the current market risk-free rate of interest;

(d) the price for bearing the uncertainty inherent in the asset; and

(e) other, sometimes unidentifiable, factors (such as illiquidity) that market participants would reflect in pricing the future cash flows the entity expects to derive from the asset.

A2 This appendix contrasts two approaches to computing present value, either of which may be used to estimate the value in use of an asset, depending on the circumstances. Under the 'traditional' approach, adjustments for factors (b)-(e) described in paragraph A1 are embedded in the discount rate. Under the 'expected cash flow' approach, factors (b), (d) and (e) cause adjustments in arriving at risk-adjusted expected cash flows. Whichever approach an entity adopts to reflect expectations about possible variations in the amount or timing of future cash flows, the result should be to reflect the expected present value of the future cash flows, ie the weighted average of all possible outcomes.

A3 **General principles**

The techniques used to estimate future cash flows and interest rates will vary from one situation to another depending on the circumstances surrounding the asset in question. However, the following general principles govern any application of present value techniques in measuring assets:

(a) interest rates used to discount cash flows should reflect assumptions that are consistent with those inherent in the estimated cash flows. Otherwise, the effect of some assumptions will be double-counted or ignored. For example, a discount rate of 12 per cent might be applied to contractual cash flows of a loan receivable. That rate reflects expectations about future defaults from loans with particular characteristics. That same 12 per cent rate should not be used to

IAS 36

(e) evaluate whether both sets of cash flows are likely to behave (ie vary)
in a similar fashion in changing economic conditions.

A7 **Expected cash flow approach**
The expected cash flow approach is, in some situations, a more effective measurement tool than the traditional approach. In developing a measurement, the expected cash flow approach uses all expectations about possible cash flows instead of the single most likely cash flow. For example, a cash flow might be CU100, CU200 or CU300 with probabilities of 10 per cent, 60 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively. The expected cash flow is CU220. The expected cash flow approach thus differs from the traditional approach by focusing on direct analysis of the cash flows in question and on more explicit statements of the assumptions used in the measurement.

A8 The expected cash flow approach also allows use of present value techniques when the timing of cash flows is uncertain. For example, a cash flow of CU1,000 may be received in one year, two years or three years with probabilities of 10 per cent, 60 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively. The example below shows the computation of expected present value in that situation.

|                                                  |         |         |
| :----------------------------------------------- | :------ | :------ |
| Present value of CU1,000 in 1 year at 5%        | CU952.38 |         |
| Probability                                      | 10.00%  | CU95.24 |
| Present value of CU1,000 in 2 years at 5.25%     | CU902.73 |         |
| Probability                                      | 60.00%  | CU541.64 |
| Present value of CU1,000 in 3 years at 5.50%     | CU851.61 |         |
| Probability                                      | 30.00%  | CU255.48 |
| Expected present value                           |         | CU892.36 |

A9 The expected present value of CU892.36 differs from the traditional notion of a best estimate of CU902.73 (the 60 per cent probability). A traditional present value computation applied to this example requires a decision about which of the possible timings of cash flows to use and, accordingly, would not reflect the probabilities of other timings. This is because the discount rate in a traditional present value computation cannot reflect uncertainties in timing.

A10 The use of probabilities is an essential element of the expected cash flow approach. Some question whether assigning probabilities to highly subjective estimates suggests greater precision than, in fact, exists. However, the proper application of the traditional approach (as described in paragraph A6) requires the same estimates and subjectivity without providing the computational transparency of the expected cash flow approach.

A11 Many estimates developed in current practice already incorporate the elements of expected cash flows informally. In addition, accountants often face the need to measure an asset using limited information about the probabilities of possible cash flows. For example, an accountant might be confronted with the following situations:
