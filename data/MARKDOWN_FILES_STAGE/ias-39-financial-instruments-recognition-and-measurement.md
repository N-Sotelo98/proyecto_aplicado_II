# Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement

In April 2001 the International Accounting Standards Board (Board) adopted IAS 39 *Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement*, which had originally been issued by the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) in March 1999. That Standard had replaced the original IAS 39 *Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement*, which had been issued in December 1998. That original IAS 39 had replaced some parts of IAS 25 *Accounting for Investments*, which had been issued in March 1986.

In December 2003 the Board issued a revised IAS 39 as part of its initial agenda of technical projects. The revised IAS 39 also incorporated an Implementation Guidance section, which replaced a series of Questions & Answers that had been developed by the IAS 39 Implementation Guidance Committee.

Following that, the Board made further amendments to IAS 39:

(a) in March 2004, to enable fair value hedge accounting to be used for a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk;

(b) in June 2005, relating to when the fair value option could be applied;

(c) in July 2008, to provide application guidance to illustrate how the principles underlying hedge accounting should be applied;

(d) in October 2008, to allow some types of financial assets to be reclassified; and

(e) in March 2009, to address how some embedded derivatives should be measured if they were previously reclassified.

In August 2005 the Board issued IFRS 7 *Financial Instruments: Disclosures*. Consequently, the disclosure requirements that were in IAS 39 were moved to IFRS 7.

In September 2019 the Board amended IFRS 9 and IAS 39 by issuing *Interest Rate Benchmark Reform* to provide specific exceptions to hedge accounting requirements in IFRS 9 and IAS 39 for (a) highly probable requirement; (b) prospective assessments; (c) retrospective assessment (IAS 39 only); and (d) separately identifiable risk components. *Interest Rate Benchmark Reform* also amended IFRS 7 to add specific disclosure requirements for hedging relationships to which an entity applies the exceptions in IFRS 9 or IAS 39.

In August 2020 the Board issued *Interest Rate Benchmark Reform—Phase 2* which amended requirements in IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 relating to:

*   changes in the basis for determining contractual cash flows of financial assets, financial liabilities and lease liabilities;
*   hedge accounting; and
*   disclosures.

The Phase 2 amendments apply only to changes required by the interest rate benchmark reform to financial instruments and hedging relationships.

# IAS 39

Other Standards have made minor consequential amendments to IAS 39. They include IAS 1 *Presentation of Financial Statements* (issued September 2007), IAS 27 *Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements* (issued January 2008), *Improvements to IFRSs* (issued May 2008), *Eligible Hedged Items (Amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement)* (issued July 2008), *Improvements to IFRSs* (issued April 2009), IFRS 13 *Fair Value Measurement* (issued May 2011), *Investment Entities (Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27)* (issued October 2012), *Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting (Amendments to IAS 39)* (issued June 2013), IFRS 9 *Financial Instruments (Hedge Accounting and amendments to IFRS 9, IFRS 7 and IAS 39)* (issued November 2013), IFRS 15 *Revenue from Contracts with Customers* (issued May 2014) and IFRS 9 *Financial Instruments* (issued July 2014).

In response to requests from interested parties that the accounting for financial instruments should be improved quickly, the Board divided its project to replace IAS 39 into three main phases. As the Board completed each phase, it issued chapters in IFRS 9 that replaced the corresponding requirements in IAS 39. The Board had always intended that IFRS 9 Financial Instruments would replace IAS 39 in its entirety. However, IFRS 9 permits an entity to choose as its accounting policy either to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9 or to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements in IAS 39. Consequently, although IFRS 9 is effective (with limited exceptions for entities that issue insurance contracts and entities applying the IFRS for SMEs Standard), IAS 39, which now contains only its requirements for hedge accounting, also remains effective.

IAS 39

International Accounting Standard 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (IAS 39) is set out in paragraphs 2–110 and Appendices A and B. All the paragraphs have equal authority but retain the IASC format of the Standard when it was adopted by the IASB. IAS 39 should be read in the context of its objective and the Basis for Conclusions, the Preface to IFRS Standards and the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting. IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors provides a basis for selecting and applying accounting policies in the absence of explicit guidance.

**International Accounting Standard 39**
**Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement**

1 [Deleted]

**Scope**

2 This Standard shall be applied by all entities to all financial instruments within the scope of IFRS 9 *Financial Instruments* if, and to the extent that:

(a) IFRS 9 permits the hedge accounting requirements of this Standard to be applied; and

(b) the financial instrument is part of a hedging relationship that qualifies for hedge accounting in accordance with this Standard.

2A-7 [Deleted]

**Definitions**

8 The terms defined in IFRS 13, IFRS 9 and IAS 32 are used in this Standard with the meanings specified in Appendix A of IFRS 13, Appendix A of IFRS 9 and paragraph 11 of IAS 32. IFRS 13, IFRS 9 and IAS 32 define the following terms:

*   amortised cost of a financial asset or financial liability
*   derecognition
*   derivative
*   effective interest method
*   effective interest rate
*   equity instrument
*   fair value
*   financial asset
*   financial instrument
*   financial liability

and provide guidance on applying those definitions.

9 The following terms are used in this Standard with the meanings specified:

**Definitions relating to hedge accounting**

*A firm commitment* is a binding agreement for the exchange of a specified quantity of resources at a specified price on a specified future date or dates.

*A forecast transaction* is an uncommitted but anticipated future transaction.

IAS 39

hedge accounting in the consolidated financial statements of the group. However, they may qualify for hedge accounting in the individual or separate financial statements of individual entities within the group provided that they are external to the individual entity that is being reported on.

**Designation of hedging instruments**

74 There is normally a single fair value measure for a hedging instrument in its entirety, and the factors that cause changes in fair value are co-dependent. Thus, a hedging relationship is designated by an entity for a hedging instrument in its entirety. The only exceptions permitted are:

(a) separating the intrinsic value and time value of an option contract and designating as the hedging instrument only the change in intrinsic value of an option and excluding change in its time value; and

(b) separating the interest element and the spot price of a forward contract.

These exceptions are permitted because the intrinsic value of the option and the premium on the forward can generally be measured separately. A dynamic hedging strategy that assesses both the intrinsic value and time value of an option contract can qualify for hedge accounting.

75 A proportion of the entire hedging instrument, such as 50 per cent of the notional amount, may be designated as the hedging instrument in a hedging relationship. However, a hedging relationship may not be designated for only a portion of the time period during which a hedging instrument remains outstanding.

76 A single hedging instrument may be designated as a hedge of more than one type of risk provided that (a) the risks hedged can be identified clearly; (b) the effectiveness of the hedge can be demonstrated; and (c) it is possible to ensure that there is specific designation of the hedging instrument and different risk positions.

77 Two or more derivatives, or proportions of them (or, in the case of a hedge of currency risk, two or more non-derivatives or proportions of them, or a combination of derivatives and non-derivatives or proportions of them), may be viewed in combination and jointly designated as the hedging instrument, including when the risk(s) arising from some derivatives offset(s) those arising from others. However, an interest rate collar or other derivative instrument that combines a written option and a purchased option does not qualify as a hedging instrument if it is, in effect, a net written option (for which a net premium is received). Similarly, two or more instruments (or proportions of them) may be designated as the hedging instrument only if none of them is a written option or a net written option.

# Hedged items

## Qualifying items

78 A hedged item can be a recognised asset or liability, an unrecognised firm commitment, a highly probable forecast transaction or a net investment in a foreign operation. The hedged item can be (a) a single asset, liability, firm commitment, highly probable forecast transaction or net investment in a foreign operation, (b) a group of assets, liabilities, firm commitments, highly probable forecast transactions or net investments in foreign operations with similar risk characteristics or (c) in a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk only, a portion of the portfolio of financial assets or financial liabilities that share the risk being hedged.

79 [Deleted]

80 For hedge accounting purposes, only assets, liabilities, firm commitments or highly probable forecast transactions that involve a party external to the entity can be designated as hedged items. It follows that hedge accounting can be applied to transactions between entities in the same group only in the individual or separate financial statements of those entities and not in the consolidated financial statements of the group, except for the consolidated financial statements of an investment entity, as defined in IFRS 10, where transactions between an investment entity and its subsidiaries measured at fair value through profit or loss will not be eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. As an exception, the foreign currency risk of an intragroup monetary item (eg a payable/receivable between two subsidiaries) may qualify as a hedged item in the consolidated financial statements if it results in an exposure to foreign exchange rate gains or losses that are not fully eliminated on consolidation in accordance with IAS 21 *The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates*. In accordance with IAS 21, foreign exchange rate gains and losses on intragroup monetary items are not fully eliminated on consolidation when the intragroup monetary item is transacted between two group entities that have different functional currencies. In addition, the foreign currency risk of a highly probable forecast intragroup transaction may qualify as a hedged item in consolidated financial statements provided that the transaction is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity entering into that transaction and the foreign currency risk will affect consolidated profit or loss.

## Designation of financial items as hedged items

81 If the hedged item is a financial asset or financial liability, it may be a hedged item with respect to the risks associated with only a portion of its cash flows or fair value (such as one or more selected contractual cash flows or portions of them or a percentage of the fair value) provided that effectiveness can be measured. For example, an identifiable and separately measurable portion of the interest rate exposure of an interest-bearing asset or interest-bearing liability may be designated as the hedged risk (such as a risk-free interest rate or benchmark interest rate component of the total interest rate exposure of a hedged financial instrument).

IAS 39

**Reclassifying the cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income**

102E
For the purpose of applying the requirement in paragraph 101(c) in order to determine whether the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, an entity shall assume that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows (contractually or non-contractually specified) are based is not altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform.

**Effectiveness assessment**

102F
For the purpose of applying the requirements in paragraphs 88(b) and AG105(a), an entity shall assume that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows and/or the hedged risk (contractually or non-contractually specified) are based, or the interest rate benchmark on which the cash flows of the hedging instrument are based, is not altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform.

102G
For the purpose of applying the requirement in paragraph 88(e), an entity is not required to discontinue a hedging relationship because the actual results of the hedge do not meet the requirements in paragraph AG105(b). For the avoidance of doubt, an entity shall apply the other conditions in paragraph 88, including the prospective assessment in paragraph 88(b), to assess whether the hedging relationship must be discontinued.

**Designating financial items as hedged items**

102H
Unless paragraph 1021 applies, for a hedge of a non-contractually specified benchmark portion of interest rate risk, an entity shall apply the requirement in paragraphs 81 and AG99F-that the designated portion shall be separately identifiable - only at the inception of the hedging relationship.

102I
When an entity, consistent with its hedge documentation, frequently resets (ie discontinues and restarts) a hedging relationship because both the hedging instrument and the hedged item frequently change (ie the entity uses a dynamic process in which both the hedged items and the hedging instruments used to manage that exposure do not remain the same for long), the entity shall apply the requirement in paragraphs 81 and AG99F-that the designated portion is separately identifiable-only when it initially designates a hedged item in that hedging relationship. A hedged item that has been assessed at the time of its initial designation in the hedging relationship, whether it was at the time of the hedge inception or subsequently, is not reassessed at any subsequent redesignation in the same hedging relationship.

**End of application**

102J
An entity shall prospectively cease applying paragraph 102D to a hedged item at the earlier of:

(a) when the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform is no longer present with respect to the timing and the amount of the interest rate benchmark-based cash flows of the hedged item; and

102Z3 In addition to those hedging relationships specified in paragraph 102P, an entity shall apply the requirements in paragraphs 102Z1 and 102Z2 to new hedging relationships in which an alternative benchmark rate is designated as a non-contractually specified risk portion (see paragraphs 81 and AG99F) when, because of interest rate benchmark reform, that risk portion is not separately identifiable at the date it is designated.

**Effective date and transition**

103 An entity shall apply this Standard (including the amendments issued in March 2004) for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005. Earlier application is permitted.

IAS 39

meets the condition in (a), the entity would conclude that the hedge has been highly effective.

AG106 Effectiveness is assessed, at a minimum, at the time an entity prepares its annual or interim financial statements.

AG107 This Standard does not specify a single method for assessing hedge effectiveness. The method an entity adopts for assessing hedge effectiveness depends on its risk management strategy. For example, if the entity's risk management strategy is to adjust the amount of the hedging instrument periodically to reflect changes in the hedged position, the entity needs to demonstrate that the hedge is expected to be highly effective only for the period until the amount of the hedging instrument is next adjusted. In some cases, an entity adopts different methods for different types of hedges. An entity's documentation of its hedging strategy includes its procedures for assessing effectiveness. Those procedures state whether the assessment includes all of the gain or loss on a hedging instrument or whether the instrument's time value is excluded.

AG107A If an entity hedges less than 100 per cent of the exposure on an item, such as 85 per cent, it shall designate the hedged item as being 85 per cent of the exposure and shall measure ineffectiveness based on the change in that designated 85 per cent exposure. However, when hedging the designated 85 per cent exposure, the entity may use a hedge ratio of other than one to one if that improves the expected effectiveness of the hedge, as explained in paragraph AG100.

AG108 If the principal terms of the hedging instrument and of the hedged asset, liability, firm commitment or highly probable forecast transaction are the same, the changes in fair value and cash flows attributable to the risk being hedged may be likely to offset each other fully, both when the hedge is entered into and afterwards. For example, an interest rate swap is likely to be an effective hedge if the notional and principal amounts, term, repricing dates, dates of interest and principal receipts and payments, and basis for measuring interest rates are the same for the hedging instrument and the hedged item. In addition, a hedge of a highly probable forecast purchase of a commodity with a forward contract is likely to be highly effective if:

(a) the forward contract is for the purchase of the same quantity of the same commodity at the same time and location as the hedged forecast purchase;

(b) the fair value of the forward contract at inception is zero; and

(c) either the change in the discount or premium on the forward contract is excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and recognised in profit or loss or the change in expected cash flows on the highly probable forecast transaction is based on the forward price for the commodity.

IAS 39

AG109 Sometimes the hedging instrument offsets only part of the hedged risk.
For example, a hedge would not be fully effective if the hedging instrument
and hedged item are denominated in different currencies that do not move in
tandem. Also, a hedge of interest rate risk using a derivative would not be
fully effective if part of the change in the fair value of the derivative is
attributable to the counterparty's credit risk.

AG110 To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge must relate to a specific identified
and designated risk, and not merely to the entity's general business risks, and
must ultimately affect the entity's profit or loss. A hedge of the risk of
obsolescence of a physical asset or the risk of expropriation of property by a
government is not eligible for hedge accounting; effectiveness cannot be
measured because those risks are not measurable reliably.

AG110A Paragraph 74(a) permits an entity to separate the intrinsic value and time
value of an option contract and designate as the hedging instrument only the
change in the intrinsic value of the option contract. Such a designation may
result in a hedging relationship that is perfectly effective in achieving
offsetting changes in cash flows attributable to a hedged one-sided risk of a
forecast transaction, if the principal terms of the forecast
transaction and hedging instrument are the same.

AG110B If an entity designates a purchased option in its entirety as the hedging
instrument of a one-sided risk arising from a forecast transaction, the hedging
relationship will not be perfectly effective. This is because the premium paid
for the option includes time value and, as stated in paragraph AG99BA, a
designated one-sided risk does not include the time value of an option.
Therefore, in this situation, there will be no offset between the cash flows
relating to the time value of the option premium paid and the designated
hedged risk.

AG111 In the case of interest rate risk, hedge effectiveness may be assessed by
preparing a maturity schedule for financial assets and financial liabilities that
shows the net interest rate exposure for each time period, provided that the
net exposure is associated with a specific asset or liability (or a specific group
of assets or liabilities or a specific portion of them) giving rise to the net
exposure, and hedge effectiveness is assessed against that asset or liability.

AG112 In assessing the effectiveness of a hedge, an entity generally considers the
time value of money. The fixed interest rate on a hedged item need not exactly
match the fixed interest rate on a swap designated as a fair value hedge. Nor
does the variable interest rate on an interest-bearing asset or liability need to
be the same as the variable interest rate on a swap designated as a cash flow
hedge. A swap's fair value derives from its net settlements. The fixed and
variable rates on a swap can be changed without affecting the net settlement
if both are changed by the same amount.

AG113 If an entity does not meet hedge effectiveness criteria, the entity discontinues
hedge accounting from the last date on which compliance with hedge
effectiveness was demonstrated. However, if the entity identifies the event or
change in circumstances that caused the hedging relationship to fail the
effectiveness criteria, and demonstrates that the hedge was effective before

IAS 39

included when determining the change in the fair value of the hedged item. Consequently, if the expected repricing dates are revised (eg to reflect a change in expected prepayments), or if actual repricing dates differ from those expected, ineffectiveness will arise as described in paragraph AG126. Conversely, changes in expected repricing dates that (a) clearly arise from factors other than changes in the hedged interest rate, (b) are uncorrelated with changes in the hedged interest rate and (c) can be reliably separated from changes that are attributable to the hedged interest rate (eg changes in prepayment rates clearly arising from a change in demographic factors or tax regulations rather than changes in interest rate) are excluded when determining the change in the fair value of the hedged item, because they are not attributable to the hedged risk. If there is uncertainty about the factor that gave rise to the change in expected repricing dates or the entity is not able to separate reliably the changes that arise from the hedged interest rate from those that arise from other factors, the change is assumed to arise from changes in the hedged interest rate.

AG122 The Standard does not specify the techniques used to determine the amount referred to in paragraph AG114(g), namely the change in the fair value of the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk. If statistical or other estimation techniques are used for such measurement, management must expect the result to approximate closely that which would have been obtained from measurement of all the individual assets or liabilities that constitute the hedged item. It is not appropriate to assume that changes in the fair value of the hedged item equal changes in the value of the hedging instrument.

AG123 Paragraph 89A requires that if the hedged item for a particular repricing time period is an asset, the change in its value is presented in a separate line item within assets. Conversely, if the hedged item for a particular repricing time period is a liability, the change in its value is presented in a separate line item within liabilities. These are the separate line items referred to in paragraph AG114(g). Specific allocation to individual assets (or liabilities) is not required.

AG124 Paragraph AG114(i) notes that ineffectiveness arises to the extent that the change in the fair value of the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk differs from the change in the fair value of the hedging derivative. Such a difference may arise for a number of reasons, including:

(a) actual repricing dates being different from those expected, or expected repricing dates being revised;

(b) items in the hedged portfolio becoming impaired or being derecognised;

(c) the payment dates of the hedging instrument and the hedged item being different; and

(d) other causes (eg when a few of the hedged items bear interest at a rate below the benchmark rate for which they are designated as being hedged, and the resulting ineffectiveness is not so great that the portfolio as a whole fails to qualify for hedge accounting).

A1560
```

####End####```markdown
IAS 39

AG125 Such ineffectiveness shall be identified and recognised in profit or loss.
Generally, the effectiveness of the hedge will be improved:

(a) if the entity schedules items with different prepayment characteristics in a way that takes account of the differences in prepayment behaviour.

(b) when the number of items in the portfolio is larger. When only a few items are contained in the portfolio, relatively high ineffectiveness is likely if one of the items prepays earlier or later than expected. Conversely, when the portfolio contains many items, the prepayment behaviour can be predicted more accurately.

(c) when the repricing time periods used are narrower (eg 1-month as opposed to 3-month repricing time periods). Narrower repricing time periods reduce the effect of any mismatch between the repricing and payment dates (within the repricing time period) of the hedged item and those of the hedging instrument.

(d) the greater the frequency with which the amount of the hedging instrument is adjusted to reflect changes in the hedged item (eg because of changes in prepayment expectations).

AG126 An entity tests effectiveness periodically. If estimates of repricing dates change between one date on which an entity assesses effectiveness and the next, it shall calculate the amount of effectiveness either:

(a) as the difference between the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument (see paragraph AG114(h)) and the change in the value of the entire hedged item that is attributable to changes in the hedged interest rate (including the effect that changes in the hedged interest rate have on the fair value of any embedded prepayment option); or

(b) using the following approximation. The entity:

   (i) calculates the percentage of the assets (or liabilities) in each repricing time period that was hedged, on the basis of the estimated repricing dates at the last date it tested effectiveness.

   (ii) applies this percentage to its revised estimate of the amount in that repricing time period to calculate the amount of the hedged item based on its revised estimate.

   (iii) calculates the change in the fair value of its revised estimate of the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk and presents it as set out in paragraph AG114(g).

   (iv) recognises ineffectiveness equal to the difference between the amount determined in (iii) and the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument (see paragraph AG114(h)).

8 The same materiality considerations apply in this context as apply throughout IFRSs.
