# Financial Instruments: Disclosures

In April 2001 the International Accounting Standards Board (Board) adopted IAS 30 *Disclosures in the Financial Statements of Banks and Similar Financial Institutions,* which had originally been issued by the International Accounting Standards Committee in August 1990.

In August 2005 the Board issued IFRS 7 *Financial Instruments,* which replaced IAS 30 and carried forward the disclosure requirements in IAS 32 *Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation*. IAS 32 was subsequently renamed as IAS 32 *Financial Instruments: Presentation*. IAS 1 *Presentation of Financial Statements* (as revised in 2007) amended the terminology used throughout IFRS, including IFRS 7. In March 2009 the IASB enhanced the disclosures about fair value and liquidity risks in IFRS 7.

The Board also amended IFRS 7 to reflect that a new financial instruments Standard was issued – IFRS 9 *Financial Instruments*, which related to the classification of financial assets and financial liabilities.

IFRS 7 was also amended in October 2010 to require entities to supplement disclosures for all transferred financial assets that are not derecognised where there has been some continuing involvement in a transferred asset. The Board amended IFRS 7 in December 2011 to improve disclosures in netting arrangements associated with financial assets and financial liabilities.

In May 2017 when IFRS 17 *Insurance Contracts* was issued, it added disclosure requirements for when an entity applies an exemption for specified treasury shares or for an entity's own repurchased financial liabilities in specific circumstances.

In September 2019 the Board amended IFRS 9 and IAS 39 by issuing *Interest Rate Benchmark Reform* to provide specific exceptions to hedge accounting requirements in IFRS 9 and IAS 39 for (a) highly probable requirement; (b) prospective assessments; (c) retrospective assessment (IAS 39 only); and (d) separately identifiable risk components. *Interest Rate Benchmark Reform* also amended IFRS 7 to add specific disclosure requirements for hedging relationships to which an entity applies the exceptions in IFRS 9 or IAS 39.

In August 2020 the Board issued *Interest Rate Benchmark Reform—Phase 2* which amended requirements in IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 relating to:

*   changes in the basis for determining contractual cash flows of financial assets, financial liabilities and lease liabilities;
*   hedge accounting; and
*   disclosures.

The Phase 2 amendments apply only to changes required by the interest rate benchmark reform to financial instruments and hedging relationships.

IFRS 7

International Financial Reporting Standard 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures (IFRS 7) is set out in paragraphs 1–45 and Appendices A–C. All the paragraphs have equal authority. Paragraphs in **bold** type state the main principles. Terms defined in Appendix A are in *italics* the first time they appear in the Standard. Definitions of other terms are given in the Glossary for International Financial Reporting Standards. IFRS 7 should be read in the context of its objective and the Basis for Conclusions, the *Preface to IFRS Standards* and the *Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting*. IAS 8 *Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors* provides a basis for selecting and applying accounting policies in the absence of explicit guidance.

# International Financial Reporting Standard 7
## Financial Instruments: Disclosures

### Objective

1.  The objective of this IFRS is to require entities to provide disclosures in their financial statements that enable users to evaluate:

    (a) the significance of financial instruments for the entity's financial position and performance; and

    (b) the nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments to which the entity is exposed during the period and at the end of the reporting period, and how the entity manages those risks.

2.  The principles in this IFRS complement the principles for recognising, measuring and presenting financial assets and financial liabilities in IAS 32 *Financial Instruments: Presentation* and IFRS 9 *Financial Instruments*.

### Scope

3.  This IFRS shall be applied by all entities to all types of financial instruments, except:

    (a) those interests in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures that are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 10 *Consolidated Financial Statements*, IAS 27 *Separate Financial Statements* or IAS 28 *Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures*. However, in some cases, IFRS 10, IAS 27 or IAS 28 require or permit an entity to account for an interest in a subsidiary, associate or joint venture using IFRS 9; in those cases, entities shall apply the requirements of this IFRS and, for those measured at fair value, the requirements of IFRS 13 *Fair Value Measurement*. Entities shall also apply this IFRS to all derivatives linked to interests in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures unless the derivative meets the definition of an equity instrument in IAS 32.

    (b) employers' rights and obligations arising from employee benefit plans, to which IAS 19 *Employee Benefits* applies.

    (c) [deleted]

    (d) insurance contracts as defined in IFRS 17 *Insurance Contracts* or investment contracts with discretionary participation features within the scope of IFRS 17. However, this IFRS applies to:

    (i) derivatives that are embedded in contracts within the scope of IFRS 17, if IFRS 9 requires the entity to account for them separately.

    (ii) investment components that are separated from contracts within the scope of IFRS 17, if IFRS 17 requires such separation, unless the separated investment component is an investment contract with discretionary participation features.
####End##### IFRS 7

(iii) an issuer's rights and obligations arising under insurance contracts that meet the definition of *financial guarantee contracts*, if the issuer applies IFRS 9 in recognising and measuring the contracts. However, the issuer shall apply IFRS 17 if the issuer elects, in accordance with paragraph 7(e) of IFRS 17, to apply IFRS 17 in recognising and measuring the contracts.

(iv) an entity's rights and obligations that are financial instruments arising under credit card contracts, or similar contracts that provide credit or payment arrangements, that an entity issues that meet the definition of an insurance contract if the entity applies IFRS 9 to those rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph 7(h) of IFRS 17 and paragraph 2.1(e)(iv) of IFRS 9.

(v) an entity's rights and obligations that are financial instruments arising under insurance contracts that an entity issues that limit the compensation for insured events to the amount otherwise required to settle the policyholder's obligation created by the contract, if the entity elects, in accordance with paragraph 8A of IFRS 17, to apply IFRS 9 instead of IFRS 17 to such contracts.

(e) financial instruments, contracts and obligations under share-based payment transactions to which IFRS 2 *Share-based Payment* applies, except that this IFRS applies to contracts within the scope of IFRS 9.

(f) instruments that are required to be classified as equity instruments in accordance with paragraphs 16A and 16B or paragraphs 16C and 16D of IAS 32.

4 This IFRS applies to recognised and unrecognised financial instruments. Recognised financial instruments include financial assets and financial liabilities that are within the scope of IFRS 9. Unrecognised financial instruments include some financial instruments that, although outside the scope of IFRS 9, are within the scope of this IFRS.

5 This IFRS applies to contracts to buy or sell a non-financial item that are within the scope of IFRS 9.

5A The credit risk disclosure requirements in paragraphs 35A-35N apply to those rights that IFRS 15 *Revenue from Contracts with Customers* specifies are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 9 for the purposes of recognising impairment gains or losses. Any reference to financial assets or financial instruments in these paragraphs shall include those rights unless otherwise specified.

## Classes of financial instruments and level of disclosure

6 When this IFRS requires disclosures by class of financial instrument, an entity shall group financial instruments into classes that are appropriate to the nature of the information disclosed and that take into account the characteristics of those financial instruments. An entity shall provide

# IFRS 7

sufficient information to permit reconciliation to the line items presented in the statement of financial position.

## Significance of financial instruments for financial position and performance

7 An entity shall disclose information that enables users of its financial statements to evaluate the significance of financial instruments for its financial position and performance.

### Statement of financial position

#### Categories of financial assets and financial liabilities

8 The carrying amounts of each of the following categories, as specified in IFRS 9, shall be disclosed either in the statement of financial position or in the notes:
(a) financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss, showing separately (i) those designated as such upon initial recognition or subsequently in accordance with paragraph 6.7.1 of IFRS 9; (ii) those measured as such in accordance with the election in paragraph 3.3.5 of IFRS 9; (iii) those measured as such in accordance with the election in paragraph 33A of IAS 32 and (iv) those mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9.
(b)-(d) [deleted]
(e) financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, showing separately (i) those designated as such upon initial recognition or subsequently in accordance with paragraph 6.7.1 of IFRS 9 and (ii) those that meet the definition of held for trading in IFRS 9.
(f) financial assets measured at amortised cost.
(g) financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
(h) financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, showing separately (i) financial assets that are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income in accordance with paragraph 4.1.2A of IFRS 9; and (ii) investments in equity instruments designated as such upon initial recognition in accordance with paragraph 5.7.5 of IFRS 9.

9 **Financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss**

If the entity has designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss a financial asset (or group of financial assets) that would otherwise be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income or amortised cost, it shall disclose:

IFRS 7

11B If an entity derecognised investments in equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income during the reporting period, it shall disclose:
(a) the reasons for disposing of the investments.
(b) the fair value of the investments at the date of derecognition.
(c) the cumulative gain or loss on disposal.

**Reclassification**

12-12A [Deleted]

12B An entity shall disclose if, in the current or previous reporting periods, it has reclassified any financial assets in accordance with paragraph 4.4.1 of IFRS 9. For each such event, an entity shall disclose:
(a) the date of reclassification.
(b) a detailed explanation of the change in business model and a qualitative description of its effect on the entity's financial statements.
(c) the amount reclassified into and out of each category.

12C For each reporting period following reclassification until derecognition, an entity shall disclose for assets reclassified out of the fair value through profit or loss category so that they are measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income in accordance with paragraph 4.4.1 of IFRS 9:
(a) the effective interest rate determined on the date of reclassification; and
(b) the interest revenue recognised.

12D If, since its last annual reporting date, an entity has reclassified financial assets out of the fair value through other comprehensive income category so that they are measured at amortised cost or out of the fair value through profit or loss category so that they are measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income it shall disclose:
(a) the fair value of the financial assets at the end of the reporting period; and
(b) the fair value gain or loss that would have been recognised in profit or loss or other comprehensive income during the reporting period if the financial assets had not been reclassified.

13 [Deleted]

**Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities**

13A The disclosures in paragraphs 13B-13E supplement the other disclosure requirements of this IFRS and are required for all recognised financial instruments that are set off in accordance with paragraph 42 of IAS 32. These disclosures also apply to recognised financial instruments that are subject to

IFRS 7

21C When paragraphs 22A-24F require the entity to separate by risk category the information disclosed, the entity shall determine each risk category on the basis of the risk exposures an entity decides to hedge and for which hedge accounting is applied. An entity shall determine risk categories consistently for all hedge accounting disclosures.

21D To meet the objectives in paragraph 21A, an entity shall (except as otherwise specified below) determine how much detail to disclose, how much emphasis to place on different aspects of the disclosure requirements, the appropriate level of aggregation or disaggregation, and whether users of financial statements need additional explanations to evaluate the quantitative information disclosed. However, an entity shall use the same level of aggregation or disaggregation it uses for disclosure requirements of related information in this IFRS and IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.

**The risk management strategy**

22 [Deleted]

22A An entity shall explain its risk management strategy for each risk category of risk exposures that it decides to hedge and for which hedge accounting is applied. This explanation should enable users of financial statements to evaluate (for example):

(a) how each risk arises.

(b) how the entity manages each risk; this includes whether the entity hedges an item in its entirety for all risks or hedges a risk component (or components) of an item and why.

(c) the extent of risk exposures that the entity manages.

22B To meet the requirements in paragraph 22A, the information should include (but is not limited to) a description of:

(a) the hedging instruments that are used (and how they are used) to hedge risk exposures;

(b) how the entity determines the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument for the purpose of assessing hedge effectiveness; and

(c) how the entity establishes the hedge ratio and what the sources of hedge ineffectiveness are.

22C When an entity designates a specific risk component as a hedged item (see paragraph 6.3.7 of IFRS 9) it shall provide, in addition to the disclosures required by paragraphs 22A and 22B, qualitative or quantitative information about:

(a) how the entity determined the risk component that is designated as the hedged item (including a description of the nature of the relationship between the risk component and the item as a whole); and

The effects of hedge accounting on financial position and performance

24   [Deleted]

24A  An entity shall disclose, in a tabular format, the following amounts related to items designated as hedging instruments separately by risk category for each type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge or hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation):

(a) the carrying amount of the hedging instruments (financial assets separately from financial liabilities);

(b) the line item in the statement of financial position that includes the hedging instrument;

(c) the change in fair value of the hedging instrument used as the basis for recognising hedge ineffectiveness for the period; and

(d) the nominal amounts (including quantities such as tonnes or cubic metres) of the hedging instruments.

24B  An entity shall disclose, in a tabular format, the following amounts related to hedged items separately by risk category for the types of hedges as follows:

(a) for fair value hedges:

(i) the carrying amount of the hedged item recognised in the statement of financial position (presenting assets separately from liabilities);

(ii) the accumulated amount of fair value hedge adjustments on the hedged item included in the carrying amount of the hedged item recognised in the statement of financial position (presenting assets separately from liabilities);

(iii) the line item in the statement of financial position that includes the hedged item;

(iv) the change in value of the hedged item used as the basis for recognising hedge ineffectiveness for the period; and

(v) the accumulated amount of fair value hedge adjustments remaining in the statement of financial position for any hedged items that have ceased to be adjusted for hedging gains and losses in accordance with paragraph 6.5.10 of IFRS 9.

(b) for cash flow hedges and hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation:

(i) the change in value of the hedged item used as the basis for recognising hedge ineffectiveness for the period (ie for cash flow hedges the change in value used to determine the recognised hedge ineffectiveness in accordance with paragraph 6.5.11(c) of IFRS 9);

**Uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform**

24H For hedging relationships to which an entity applies the exceptions set out in paragraphs 6.8.4-6.8.12 of IFRS 9 or paragraphs 102D-102N of IAS 39, an entity shall disclose:

(a) the significant interest rate benchmarks to which the entity's hedging relationships are exposed;

(b) the extent of the risk exposure the entity manages that is directly affected by the interest rate benchmark reform;

(c) how the entity is managing the process to transition to alternative benchmark rates;

(d) a description of significant assumptions or judgements the entity made in applying these paragraphs (for example, assumptions or judgements about when the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform is no longer present with respect to the timing and the amount of the interest rate benchmark-based cash flows); and

(e) the nominal amount of the hedging instruments in those hedging relationships.

24I **Additional disclosures related to interest rate benchmark reform**

To enable users of financial statements to understand the effect of interest rate benchmark reform on an entity's financial instruments and risk management strategy, an entity shall disclose information about:

(a) the nature and extent of risks to which the entity is exposed arising from financial instruments subject to interest rate benchmark reform, and how the entity manages these risks; and

(b) the entity's progress in completing the transition to alternative benchmark rates, and how the entity is managing the transition.

24J To meet the objectives in paragraph 24I, an entity shall disclose:

(a) how the entity is managing the transition to alternative benchmark rates, its progress at the reporting date and the risks to which it is exposed arising from financial instruments because of the transition;

(b) disaggregated by significant interest rate benchmark subject to interest rate benchmark reform, quantitative information about financial instruments that have yet to transition to an alternative benchmark rate as at the end of the reporting period, showing separately:

(i) non-derivative financial assets;

(ii) non-derivative financial liabilities; and

(iii) derivatives; and

(c) if the risks identified in paragraph 24J(a) have resulted in changes to an entity's risk management strategy (see paragraph 22A), a description of these changes.

# IFRS 7

## Fair value

**25** Except as set out in paragraph 29, for each class of financial assets and financial liabilities (see paragraph 6), an entity shall disclose the fair value of that class of assets and liabilities in a way that permits it to be compared with its carrying amount.

**26** In disclosing fair values, an entity shall group financial assets and financial liabilities into classes, but shall offset them only to the extent that their carrying amounts are offset in the statement of financial position.

**27-27B** [Deleted]

**28** In some cases, an entity does not recognise a gain or loss on initial recognition of a financial asset or financial liability because the fair value is neither evidenced by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability (ie a Level 1 input) nor based on a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets (see paragraph B5.1.2A of IFRS 9). In such cases, the entity shall disclose by class of financial asset or financial liability:

**(a)** its accounting policy for recognising in profit or loss the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price to reflect a change in factors (including time) that market participants would take into account when pricing the asset or liability (see paragraph B5.1.2A(b) of IFRS 9).

**(b)** the aggregate difference yet to be recognised in profit or loss at the beginning and end of the period and a reconciliation of changes in the balance of this difference.

**(c)** why the entity concluded that the transaction price was not the best evidence of fair value, including a description of the evidence that supports the fair value.

**29** Disclosures of fair value are not required:

**(a)** when the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value, for example, for financial instruments such as short-term trade receivables and payables; or

**(b)** [deleted]

**(c)** [deleted]

**(d)** for lease liabilities.

**30** [Deleted]

## Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments

**31** An entity shall disclose information that enables users of its financial statements to evaluate the nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments to which the entity is exposed at the end of the reporting period.

(iii) determine whether a financial asset is a credit-impaired financial asset.

(b) how forward-looking information has been incorporated into the determination of expected credit losses, including the use of macroeconomic information; and

(c) changes in the estimation techniques or significant assumptions made during the reporting period and the reasons for those changes.

**Quantitative and qualitative information about amounts arising from expected credit losses**

35H To explain the changes in the loss allowance and the reasons for those changes, an entity shall provide, by class of financial instrument, a reconciliation from the opening balance to the closing balance of the loss allowance, in a table, showing separately the changes during the period for:

(a) the loss allowance measured at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses;

(b) the loss allowance measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses for:

(i) financial instruments for which credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition but that are not credit-impaired financial assets;

(ii) financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date (but that are not purchased or originated credit-impaired); and

(iii) trade receivables, contract assets or lease receivables for which the loss allowances are measured in accordance with paragraph 5.5.15 of IFRS 9.

(c) financial assets that are purchased or originated credit-impaired. In addition to the reconciliation, an entity shall disclose the total amount of undiscounted expected credit losses at initial recognition on financial assets initially recognised during the reporting period.

35I To enable users of financial statements to understand the changes in the loss allowance disclosed in accordance with paragraph 35H, an entity shall provide an explanation of how significant changes in the gross carrying amount of financial instruments during the period contributed to changes in the loss allowance. The information shall be provided separately for financial instruments that represent the loss allowance as listed in paragraph 35H(a)-(c) and shall include relevant qualitative and quantitative information. Examples of changes in the gross carrying amount of financial instruments that contributed to the changes in the loss allowance may include:

(a) changes because of financial instruments originated or acquired during the reporting period;

(a) how it applied the classification requirements in IFRS 9 to those financial assets whose classification has changed as a result of applying IFRS 9.

(b) the reasons for any designation or de-designation of financial assets or financial liabilities as measured at fair value through profit or loss at the date of initial application.

In accordance with paragraph 7.2.2 of IFRS 9, depending on the entity's chosen approach to applying IFRS 9, the transition can involve more than one date of initial application. Therefore this paragraph may result in disclosure on more than one date of initial application.

42K In the reporting period that an entity first applies the classification and measurement requirements for financial assets in IFRS 9 (ie when the entity transitions from IAS 39 to IFRS 9 for financial assets), it shall present the disclosures set out in paragraphs 42L-42O of this IFRS as required by paragraph 7.2.15 of IFRS 9.

42L When required by paragraph 42K, an entity shall disclose the changes in the classifications of financial assets and financial liabilities as at the date of initial application of IFRS 9, showing separately:

(a) the changes in the carrying amounts on the basis of their measurement categories in accordance with IAS 39 (ie not resulting from a change in measurement attribute on transition to IFRS 9); and

(b) the changes in the carrying amounts arising from a change in measurement attribute on transition to IFRS 9.

The disclosures in this paragraph need not be made after the annual reporting period in which the entity initially applies the classification and measurement requirements for financial assets in IFRS 9.

42M When required by paragraph 42K, an entity shall disclose the following for financial assets and financial liabilities that have been reclassified so that they are measured at amortised cost and, in the case of financial assets, that have been reclassified out of fair value through profit or loss so that they are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, as a result of the transition to IFRS 9:

(a) the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities at the end of the reporting period; and

(b) the fair value gain or loss that would have been recognised in profit or loss or other comprehensive income during the reporting period if the financial assets or financial liabilities had not been reclassified.

The disclosures in this paragraph need not be made after the annual reporting period in which the entity initially applies the classification and measurement requirements for financial assets in IFRS 9.

42N When required by paragraph 42K, an entity shall disclose the following for financial assets and financial liabilities that have been reclassified out of the fair value through profit or loss category as a result of the transition to IFRS 9:

IFRS 7

(a) the effective interest rate determined on the date of initial application; and
(b) the interest revenue or expense recognised.

If an entity treats the fair value of a financial asset or a financial liability as the new gross carrying amount at the date of initial application (see paragraph 7.2.11 of IFRS 9), the disclosures in this paragraph shall be made for each reporting period until derecognition. Otherwise, the disclosures in this paragraph need not be made after the annual reporting period in which the entity initially applies the classification and measurement requirements for financial assets in IFRS 9.

42O When an entity presents the disclosures set out in paragraphs 42K-42N, those disclosures, and the disclosures in paragraph 25 of this IFRS, must permit reconciliation between:

(a) the measurement categories presented in accordance with IAS 39 and IFRS 9; and
(b) the class of financial instrument as at the date of initial application.

42P On the date of initial application of Section 5.5 of IFRS 9, an entity is required to disclose information that would permit the reconciliation of the ending impairment allowances in accordance with IAS 39 and the provisions in accordance with IAS 37 to the opening loss allowances determined in accordance with IFRS 9. For financial assets, this disclosure shall be provided by the related financial assets' measurement categories in accordance with IAS 39 and IFRS 9, and shall show separately the effect of the changes in the measurement category on the loss allowance at that date.

42Q In the reporting period that includes the date of initial application of IFRS 9, an entity is not required to disclose the line item amounts that would have been reported in accordance with the classification and measurement requirements (which includes the requirements related to amortised cost measurement of financial assets and impairment in Sections 5.4 and 5.5 of IFRS 9) of:

(a) IFRS 9 for prior periods; and
(b) IAS 39 for the current period.

42R In accordance with paragraph 7.2.4 of IFRS 9, if it is impracticable (as defined in IAS 8) at the date of initial application of IFRS 9 for an entity to assess a modified time value of money element in accordance with paragraphs B4.1.9B-B4.1.9D of IFRS 9 based on the facts and circumstances that existed at the initial recognition of the financial asset, an entity shall assess the contractual cash flow characteristics of that financial asset based on the facts and circumstances that existed at the initial recognition of the financial asset without taking into account the requirements related to the modification of the time value of money element in paragraphs B4.1.9B-B4.1.9D of IFRS 9. An entity shall disclose the carrying amount at the reporting date of the financial

assets whose contractual cash flow characteristics have been assessed based on the facts and circumstances that existed at the initial recognition of the financial asset without taking into account the requirements related to the modification of the time value of money element in paragraphs B4.1.9B-B4.1.9D of IFRS 9 until those financial assets are derecognised.

42S In accordance with paragraph 7.2.5 of IFRS 9, if it is impracticable (as defined in IAS 8) at the date of initial application for an entity to assess whether the fair value of a prepayment feature was insignificant in accordance with paragraphs B4.1.12(c) of IFRS 9 based on the facts and circumstances that existed at the initial recognition of the financial asset, an entity shall assess the contractual cash flow characteristics of that financial asset based on the facts and circumstances that existed at the initial recognition of the financial asset without taking into account the exception for prepayment features in paragraph B4.1.12 of IFRS 9. An entity shall disclose the carrying amount at the reporting date of the financial assets whose contractual cash flow characteristics have been assessed based on the facts and circumstances that existed at the initial recognition of the financial asset without taking into account the exception for prepayment features in paragraph B4.1.12 of IFRS 9 until those financial assets are derecognised.

## Effective date and transition

43 An entity shall apply this IFRS for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007. Earlier application is encouraged. If an entity applies this IFRS for an earlier period, it shall disclose that fact.

44 If an entity applies this IFRS for annual periods beginning before 1 January 2006, it need not present comparative information for the disclosures required by paragraphs 31–42 about the nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments.

44A IAS 1 (as revised in 2007) amended the terminology used throughout IFRSs. In addition it amended paragraphs 20, 21, 23(c) and (d), 27(c) and B5 of Appendix B. An entity shall apply those amendments for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. If an entity applies IAS 1 (revised 2007) for an earlier period, the amendments shall be applied for that earlier period.

44B IFRS 3 (as revised in 2008) deleted paragraph 3(c). An entity shall apply that amendment for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009. If an entity applies IFRS 3 (revised 2008) for an earlier period, the amendment shall also be applied for that earlier period. However, the amendment does not apply to contingent consideration that arose from a business combination for which the acquisition date preceded the application of IFRS 3 (revised 2008). Instead, an entity shall account for such consideration in accordance with paragraphs 65A-65E of IFRS 3 (as amended in 2010).

| currency risk            | The risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| liquidity risk           | The risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| other price risk         | The risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices (other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk), whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the individual financial instrument or its issuer or by factors affecting all similar financial instruments traded in the market. |

(ii) the criteria for so designating such financial liabilities on initial recognition; and

(iii) how the entity has satisfied the conditions in paragraph 4.2.2 of IFRS 9 for such designation.

(aa) for financial assets designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss:
    
    (i) the nature of the financial assets the entity has designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss; and
    
    (ii) how the entity has satisfied the criteria in paragraph 4.1.5 of IFRS 9 for such designation.

(b) [deleted]

(c) whether regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are accounted for at trade date or at settlement date (see paragraph 3.1.2 of IFRS 9).

(d) [deleted]

(e) how net gains or net losses on each category of financial instrument are determined (see paragraph 20(a)), for example, whether the net gains or net losses on items at fair value through profit or loss include interest or dividend income.

Paragraph 122 of IAS 1 (as revised in 2007) also requires entities to disclose, along with material accounting policy information or other notes, the judgements, apart from those involving estimations, that management has made in the process of applying the entity's accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.

**Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments (paragraphs 31-42)**

B6 The disclosures required by paragraphs 31–42 shall be either given in the financial statements or incorporated by cross-reference from the financial statements to some other statement, such as a management commentary or risk report, that is available to users of the financial statements on the same terms as the financial statements and at the same time. Without the information incorporated by cross-reference, the financial statements are incomplete.

information about modified financial assets meeting the criteria in paragraph 35F(f) (i) for which the loss allowance has reverted to being measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses (ie a deterioration rate).

B8C
Paragraph 35G(a) requires the disclosure of information about the basis of inputs and assumptions and the estimation techniques used to apply the impairment requirements in IFRS 9. An entity's assumptions and inputs used to measure expected credit losses or determine the extent of increases in credit risk since initial recognition may include information obtained from internal historical information or rating reports and assumptions about the expected life of financial instruments and the timing of the sale of collateral.

## Changes in the loss allowance (paragraph 35H)

B8D
In accordance with paragraph 35H, an entity is required to explain the reasons for the changes in the loss allowance during the period. In addition to the reconciliation from the opening balance to the closing balance of the loss allowance, it may be necessary to provide a narrative explanation of the changes. This narrative explanation may include an analysis of the reasons for changes in the loss allowance during the period, including:

(a) the portfolio composition;

(b) the volume of financial instruments purchased or originated; and

(c) the severity of the expected credit losses.

B8E
For loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts the loss allowance is recognised as a provision. An entity should disclose information about the changes in the loss allowance for financial assets separately from those for loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. However, if a financial instrument includes both a loan (ie financial asset) and an undrawn commitment (ie loan commitment) component and the entity cannot separately identify the expected credit losses on the loan commitment component from those on the financial asset component, the expected credit losses on the loan commitment should be recognised together with the loss allowance for the financial asset. To the extent that the combined expected credit losses exceed the gross carrying amount of the financial asset, the expected credit losses should be recognised as a provision.

## Collateral (paragraph 35K)

B8F
Paragraph 35K requires the disclosure of information that will enable users of financial statements to understand the effect of collateral and other credit enhancements on the amount of expected credit losses. An entity is neither required to disclose information about the fair value of collateral and other credit enhancements nor is it required to quantify the exact value of the collateral that was included in the calculation of expected credit losses (ie the loss given default).

IFRS 7

B9
**Maximum credit risk exposure (paragraph 36(a))**

Paragraphs 35K(a) and 36(a) require disclosure of the amount that best represents the entity's maximum exposure to credit risk. For a financial asset, this is typically the gross carrying amount, net of:

(a) any amounts offset in accordance with IAS 32; and

(b) any loss allowance recognised in accordance with IFRS 9.

B10
Activities that give rise to credit risk and the associated maximum exposure to credit risk include, but are not limited to:

(a) granting loans to customers and placing deposits with other entities. In these cases, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying amount of the related financial assets.

(b) entering into derivative contracts, eg foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and credit derivatives. When the resulting asset is measured at fair value, the maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting period will equal the carrying amount.

(c) granting financial guarantees. In this case, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the maximum amount the entity could have to pay if the guarantee is called on, which may be significantly greater than the amount recognised as a liability.

(d) making a loan commitment that is irrevocable over the life of the facility or is revocable only in response to a material adverse change. If the issuer cannot settle the loan commitment net in cash or another financial instrument, the maximum credit exposure is the full amount of the commitment. This is because it is uncertain whether the amount of any undrawn portion may be drawn upon in the future. This may be significantly greater than the amount recognised as a liability.

B10A
**Quantitative liquidity risk disclosures (paragraphs 34(a) and 39(a) and (b))**

In accordance with paragraph 34(a) an entity discloses summary quantitative data about its exposure to liquidity risk on the basis of the information provided internally to key management personnel. An entity shall explain how those data are determined. If the outflows of cash (or another financial asset) included in those data could either:

(a) occur significantly earlier than indicated in the data, or

(b) be for significantly different amounts from those indicated in the data (eg for a derivative that is included in the data on a net settlement basis but for which the counterparty has the option to require gross settlement),

© IFRS Foundation
A323
```####End####page_1'-not-possible####End####```markdown
IFRS 7

(a) gross lease liabilities (before deducting finance charges);

(b) prices specified in forward agreements to purchase financial assets for cash;

(c) net amounts for pay-floating/receive-fixed interest rate swaps for which net cash flows are exchanged;

(d) contractual amounts to be exchanged in a derivative financial instrument (eg a currency swap) for which gross cash flows are exchanged; and

(e) gross loan commitments.

Such undiscounted cash flows differ from the amount included in the statement of financial position because the amount in that statement is based on discounted cash flows. When the amount payable is not fixed, the amount disclosed is determined by reference to the conditions existing at the end of the reporting period. For example, when the amount payable varies with changes in an index, the amount disclosed may be based on the level of the index at the end of the period.

B11E Paragraph 39(c) requires an entity to describe how it manages the liquidity risk inherent in the items disclosed in the quantitative disclosures required in paragraph 39(a) and (b). An entity shall disclose a maturity analysis of financial assets it holds for managing liquidity risk (eg financial assets that are readily saleable or expected to generate cash inflows to meet cash outflows on financial liabilities), if that information is necessary to enable users of its financial statements to evaluate the nature and extent of liquidity risk.

B11F Other factors that an entity might consider in providing the disclosure required in paragraph 39(c) include, but are not limited to, whether the entity:

(a) has committed borrowing facilities (eg commercial paper facilities) or other lines of credit (eg stand-by credit facilities) that it can access to meet liquidity needs;

(b) holds deposits at central banks to meet liquidity needs;

(c) has very diverse funding sources;

(d) has significant concentrations of liquidity risk in either its assets or its funding sources;

(e) has internal control processes and contingency plans for managing liquidity risk;

(f) has instruments that include accelerated repayment terms (eg on the downgrade of the entity's credit rating);

IFRS 7

**Other price risk**

B25 Other price risk arises on financial instruments because of changes in, for example, commodity prices or equity prices. To comply with paragraph 40, an entity might disclose the effect of a decrease in a specified stock market index, commodity price, or other risk variable. For example, if an entity gives residual value guarantees that are financial instruments, the entity discloses an increase or decrease in the value of the assets to which the guarantee applies.

B26 Two examples of financial instruments that give rise to equity price risk are (a) a holding of equities in another entity and (b) an investment in a trust that in turn holds investments in equity instruments. Other examples include forward contracts and options to buy or sell specified quantities of an equity instrument and swaps that are indexed to equity prices. The fair values of such financial instruments are affected by changes in the market price of the underlying equity instruments.

B27 In accordance with paragraph 40(a), the sensitivity of profit or loss (that arises, for example, from instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss) is disclosed separately from the sensitivity of other comprehensive income (that arises, for example, from investments in equity instruments whose changes in fair value are presented in other comprehensive income).

B28 Financial instruments that an entity classifies as equity instruments are not remeasured. Neither profit or loss nor equity will be affected by the equity price risk of those instruments. Accordingly, no sensitivity analysis is required.

**Derecognition (paragraphs 42C-42H)**

**Continuing involvement (paragraph 42C)**

B29 The assessment of continuing involvement in a transferred financial asset for the purposes of the disclosure requirements in paragraphs 42E-42H is made at the level of the reporting entity. For example, if a subsidiary transfers to an unrelated third party a financial asset in which the parent of the subsidiary has continuing involvement, the subsidiary does not include the parent's involvement in the assessment of whether it has continuing involvement in the transferred asset in its separate or individual financial statements (ie when the subsidiary is the reporting entity). However, a parent would include its continuing involvement (or that of another member of the group) in a financial asset transferred by its subsidiary in determining whether it has continuing involvement in the transferred asset in its consolidated financial statements (ie when the reporting entity is the group).

B30 An entity does not have a continuing involvement in a transferred financial asset if, as part of the transfer, it neither retains any of the contractual rights or obligations inherent in the transferred financial asset nor acquires any new contractual rights or obligations relating to the transferred financial asset. An entity does not have continuing involvement in a transferred financial asset if it has neither an interest in the future performance of the transferred

IFRS 7

B30A When an entity transfers a financial asset, the entity may retain the right to
service that financial asset for a fee that is included in, for example, a
servicing contract. The entity assesses the servicing contract in accordance
with the guidance in paragraphs 42C and B30 to decide whether the entity has
continuing involvement as a result of the servicing contract for the purposes
of the disclosure requirements. For example, a servicer will have continuing
involvement in the transferred financial asset for the purposes of the
disclosure requirements if the servicing fee is dependent on the amount or
timing of the cash flows collected from the transferred financial asset.
Similarly, a servicer has continuing involvement for the purposes of the
disclosure requirements if a fixed fee would not be paid in full because of non-
performance of the transferred financial asset. In these examples, the servicer
has an interest in the future performance of the transferred financial asset.
This assessment is independent of whether the fee to be received is expected
to compensate the entity adequately for performing the servicing.

B31 Continuing involvement in a transferred financial asset may result from
contractual provisions in the transfer agreement or in a separate agreement
with the transferee or a third party entered into in connection with the
transfer.

**Transferred financial assets that are not derecognised in their entirety (paragraph 42D)**

B32 Paragraph 42D requires disclosures when part or all of the transferred
financial assets do not qualify for derecognition. Those disclosures are
required at each reporting date at which the entity continues to recognise the
transferred financial assets, regardless of when the transfers occurred.

**Types of continuing involvement (paragraphs 42E-42H)**

B33 Paragraphs 42E-42H require qualitative and quantitative disclosures for each
type of continuing involvement in derecognised financial assets. An entity
shall aggregate its continuing involvement into types that are representative
of the entity's exposure to risks. For example, an entity may aggregate its
continuing involvement by type of financial instrument (eg guarantees or call
options) or by type of transfer (eg factoring of receivables, securitisations and
securities lending).

IFRS 7

**Maturity analysis for undiscounted cash outflows to repurchase transferred assets (paragraph 42E(e))**

B34 Paragraph 42E(e) requires an entity to disclose a maturity analysis of the undiscounted cash outflows to repurchase derecognised financial assets or other amounts payable to the transferee in respect of the derecognised financial assets, showing the remaining contractual maturities of the entity's continuing involvement. This analysis distinguishes cash flows that are required to be paid (eg forward contracts), cash flows that the entity may be required to pay (eg written put options) and cash flows that the entity might choose to pay (eg purchased call options).

B35 An entity shall use its judgement to determine an appropriate number of time bands in preparing the maturity analysis required by paragraph 42E(e). For example, an entity might determine that the following maturity time bands are appropriate:

(a) not later than one month;

(b) later than one month and not later than three months;

(c) later than three months and not later than six months;

(d) later than six months and not later than one year;

(e) later than one year and not later than three years;

(f) later than three years and not later than five years; and

(g) more than five years.

B36 If there is a range of possible maturities, the cash flows are included on the basis of the earliest date on which the entity can be required or is permitted to pay.

B37 **Qualitative information (paragraph 42E(f))**

The qualitative information required by paragraph 42E(f) includes a description of the derecognised financial assets and the nature and purpose of the continuing involvement retained after transferring those assets. It also includes a description of the risks to which an entity is exposed, including:

(a) a description of how the entity manages the risk inherent in its continuing involvement in the derecognised financial assets.

(b) whether the entity is required to bear losses before other parties, and the ranking and amounts of losses borne by parties whose interests rank lower than the entity's interest in the asset (ie its continuing involvement in the asset).

(c) a description of any triggers associated with obligations to provide financial support or to repurchase a transferred financial asset.

B38 Gain or loss on derecognition (paragraph 42G(a))

Paragraph 42G(a) requires an entity to disclose the gain or loss on derecognition relating to financial assets in which the entity has continuing involvement. The entity shall disclose if a gain or loss on derecognition arose because the fair values of the components of the previously recognised asset (ie the interest in the asset derecognised and the interest retained by the entity) were different from the fair value of the previously recognised asset as a whole. In that situation, the entity shall also disclose whether the fair value measurements included significant inputs that were not based on observable market data, as described in paragraph 27A.

B39 Supplementary information (paragraph 42H)

The disclosures required in paragraphs 42D-42G may not be sufficient to meet the disclosure objectives in paragraph 42B. If this is the case, the entity shall disclose whatever additional information is necessary to meet the disclosure objectives. The entity shall decide, in the light of its circumstances, how much additional information it needs to provide to satisfy the information needs of users and how much emphasis it places on different aspects of the additional information. It is necessary to strike a balance between burdening financial statements with excessive detail that may not assist users of financial statements and obscuring information as a result of too much aggregation.

Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities (paragraphs 13A-13F)

Scope (paragraph 13A)

B40 The disclosures in paragraphs 13B-13E are required for all recognised financial instruments that are set off in accordance with paragraph 42 of IAS 32. In addition, financial instruments are within the scope of the disclosure requirements in paragraphs 13B-13E if they are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement that covers similar financial instruments and transactions, irrespective of whether the financial instruments are set off in accordance with paragraph 42 of IAS 32.

B41 The similar agreements referred to in paragraphs 13A and B40 include derivative clearing agreements, global master repurchase agreements, global master securities lending agreements, and any related rights to financial collateral. The similar financial instruments and transactions referred to in paragraph B40 include derivatives, sale and repurchase agreements, reverse sale and repurchase agreements, securities borrowing, and securities lending agreements. Examples of financial instruments that are not within the scope of paragraph 13A are loans and customer deposits at the same institution (unless they are set off in the statement of financial position), and financial instruments that are subject only to a collateral agreement.

# IFRS 7

**Description of the rights of set-off subject to enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements (paragraph 13E)**

**B50**
An entity shall describe the types of rights of set-off and similar arrangements disclosed in accordance with paragraph 13C(d), including the nature of those rights. For example, an entity shall describe its conditional rights. For instruments subject to rights of set-off that are not contingent on a future event but that do not meet the remaining criteria in paragraph 42 of IAS 32, the entity shall describe the reason(s) why the criteria are not met. For any financial collateral received or pledged, the entity shall describe the terms of the collateral agreement (for example, when the collateral is restricted).

**Disclosure by type of financial instrument or by counterparty**

**B51**
The quantitative disclosures required by paragraph 13C(a)-(e) may be grouped by type of financial instrument or transaction (for example, derivatives, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements or securities borrowing and securities lending agreements).

**B52**
Alternatively, an entity may group the quantitative disclosures required by paragraph 13C(a)-(c) by type of financial instrument, and the quantitative disclosures required by paragraph 13C(c)-(e) by counterparty. If an entity provides the required information by counterparty, the entity is not required to identify the counterparties by name. However, designation of counterparties (Counterparty A, Counterparty B, Counterparty C, etc) shall remain consistent from year to year for the years presented to maintain comparability. Qualitative disclosures shall be considered so that further information can be given about the types of counterparties. When disclosure of the amounts in paragraph 13C(c)-(e) is provided by counterparty, amounts that are individually significant in terms of total counterparty amounts shall be separately disclosed and the remaining individually insignificant counterparty amounts shall be aggregated into one line item.

**B53**
**Other**

The specific disclosures required by paragraphs 13C-13E are minimum requirements. To meet the objective in paragraph 13B an entity may need to supplement them with additional (qualitative) disclosures, depending on the terms of the enforceable master netting arrangements and related agreements, including the nature of the rights of set-off, and their effect or potential effect on the entity's financial position.
